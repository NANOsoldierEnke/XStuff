Mod by Enke


XStuff is a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead that adds in all sorts of items. Mostly whatever pops into my head.
As a bonus, I included all of the professions from my XProfessions mod, so you don't have to install both.
To install it, simply drag and drop into you Cataclysm:DDA mods directory, then activated during world generation.

There is a code index, if you want to look into my code.

Please feel free to contact me over bugs. Either make an issue on Github, or use the forum topic.
